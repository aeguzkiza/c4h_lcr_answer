##A. The Clinical Handover Summary Scenario

This scenario represents the key clinical information typically recorded and updated as part of a clinical handover, including current problems, medications, allergies and relevant contacts.

In the first part of this scenarion, we will simply explore how to read and update a set of 'curated lists' e.g Allergies List, Problems List.

Later we will explore how to contruct a nightly Handover REport by querying into these documents and saving the queried data along with other new dat pertinent to the Handover process.
